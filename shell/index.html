			<h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          You're an intern at Grapple, and their Dev Ops group is moving all developers from their minimalist GUI to a shell. Congratulations! You've been selected as the recipient of the honor of implementation, because nobody else wanted to do it.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this MP, you will implement a simple Unix shell (e.g., bash, csh etc.) called 'wtsh'. The basic function of a shell is to accept commands as inputs and execute the corresponding programs in response.
        </p>

        <p>
          The purpose of this MP is to help you learn the basics of system calls for creating and managing processes as you implement your Shell program.
          You will write the code for your Shell program in shell.c.
          You will also be required to implement the functions in log.c, log.h, vector.c, and vector.h.
        </p>

        <p>
          Make Tom Chef, your CEO, proud.
        </p>

      <h2 id = "log">Part 1: Log</h2>
        <p>
          Your mentor has helped you split up the tasks for this assignment, and has left her notes in the .h files.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to create the Shell, you'll implement the data structure Log. The Log struct contains a Vector (an automatically-expanding array of strings) to efficiently add, search, and retrieve commands executed by the shell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a look at <strong>vector.h</strong> for implementation definitions. Know that you're responsible for testing the functionality of Vector before proceeding to the next part of the MP.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, open up <strong>log.h</strong> to know what to implement for the Log struct. As with Vector, you're responsible for testing Log's functionality for extreme edge cases before going on to the Shell part.
        </p>
        <p>
          To test your code, your mentor left you a <strong>vector_test.c</strong> and <strong>log_test.c</strong> that reflects how little she cares about testing (obviously you care a lot more).
        </p>
        <p>
          Good luck!
        </p>

      <h3 id = "logDetails">Details</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You are allowed to edit the files: <strong>log.h</strong>, <strong>log.c</strong>, <strong>vector.h</strong>, <strong>vector.c</strong></li>
          <li>You MUST implement the declared functions in the header files (or you will fail). This also means you can not modify the function signatures.</li>
          <li>You MAY add extra helper functions to your header files.</li>
          <li>You are also allowed to edit <strong>vector_test.c</strong> and <strong>log_test.c</strong>, but we will not grade them.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 id = "overview">Part 2: Shell</h2>
        <s>
          <p>Before your meeting with your mentor ended, you asked about the actual shell.</p>
          <p>"Don't worry," she said, checking her Grapple clock. "We'll talk about this when we get to it. Good luck, intern!"</p>
        </s>
        <p>A wild mentor appears with the following specs:</p>
        To execute multiple commands, your shell should run in a loop where each iteration performs the following actions:
        <ol>
        	<li>Print a command prompt</li>
        	<li>Read the command from standard input</li>
        	<li>Print the PID of the process executing the command (except for <a href = "#builtin">BUILT-IN COMMANDS</a></li>
        	<li>Decide which actions to take based on the command (exit, run program, etc.)</li>
        </ol>
        	<h3 id = "args">Task 0: Reading the Arguments</h3>
        	<p>
            Your shell will support 2 <b>optional</b> arguments which may be passed to your shell: <code>-h</code>, and <code>-f</code>.
            Multiple instances of each flag may be provided.
            We will not run your shell with both flags provided.
        	</p>
        	<ul>
        		<li>
        			<p><b>-h</b></p>
        			<p>
        				./wtsh -h<br>
        				This should print: "Shell by &lt;netid&gt;" and then run the shell.
                If multiple "-h" arguments are on the command line, only print "Shell by &lt;netid&gt;" once.
                For example
        			</p>
              <pre>
                <code>
                  ./wtsh -h <br/>
                  Shell by bschong2<br/>
                  (pid=1234)/home/user$
          			</code>
              </pre>
        		</li>
        		<li>
        			<p><b>-f</b></p>
        			<p>
        				./wtsh -f &lt;filename&gt;<br>
        				This should execute the commands in the script (one per line) with the file name &lt;filename&gt;.
                Basically you are following the instructions starting from Task 2, but read from a file instead of stdin.
                If the end-of-file is reached without seeing an exit command, the program should exit as if an exit command had been given.
                If multiple "-f" arguments are on the command line, ignore all but the last one.
                So <code>./wtsh -f foo -f bar -f baz</code> will run baz as the input file.
                For example if commands.txt is
              </p>
              <pre>
                <code>
                  cd cs241<br/>
                  echo Hey!<br/>
          			</code>
              </pre>
              Then running the shell will behave as follows.
              <pre>
                <code>
                  ./wtsh -f commands.txt<br/>
                  (pid=1234)/home/user$ cd cs241<br/>
                  (pid=1234)/home/user/cs241$ echo Hey!<br/>
                  Command executed by pid=1235<br/>
                  Hey!<br/>
                  (pid=1234)/home/user/cs241$ exit<br/>
          			</code>
              </pre>

        			<!-- </p>
        			<p>
        				[NOTE 1] It's safe to use "system()" here since the autograder only cares about the output of the commands in the script file.
        			</p>
        			<p>
        				[NOTE 2] "exit" command will not appear in the test script since there will be other test cases from stdin after the "./shell -f XXX" command. (The sample binary uses "system" function here so the shell won't exit when an "exit" command comes.)
        			</p> -->
        		</li>
        		<!-- <li>
        			<p><b>=</b></p>
        			<p>
        				./shell =<br>
        				This should print the list of environment variables in your machine. Your output may look
        				something like this: <br><br>
        			<ul>
        				"PWD=/home/["netid"]/cs241/mp1
        				<br>
        				[other environment variables]
        				<br>
        				SHELL=/bin/bash
        				<br>
        				[other environement variables]
        				<br>
        				USER=["netid"]
        				<br>
        			</ul>
        			</p>
        		</li> -->
        		<!-- <li>
        			<p><b>-t</b></p>
        			<p>
        				./shell -t<br>
        				Whenever you run a NON-BUILT-IN COMMAND (Task 4), print the time it took for the command to execute. <br>

        				ls
        				<br>
        				<br>
        			</ul>
        			It should print the folder contents followed by<br>
        			"Execution took x microseconds"<br>
        			</p>
        		</li> -->
        	</ul>
        	<!-- <p>Your shell will be run with no more than 1 argument at a time</p> -->
        	<h3 id = "print">Task 1: Printing the Command Prompt</h3>
        	<p>Your shell prompt <strong>MUST</strong> use the following format:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
          		(pid=x)/path/to/cwd$
          	</code>
          </pre>

        	You can use <code>printf("(pid=%d)%s$ ", pid, pwd)</code> to print out this prompt.
          Here pid is the current process ID and pwd is the full path to the current working directory.
          How would you get the current process ID and the full path to the current working directory?
          I leave this as an exercise to the reader.
        	<h3 id = "reading">Task 2: Reading the Command from <code>stdin</code> (or a file)</h3>
        	<p>
        		Read a line from stdin (or from the file that was specified on the command line with the -f option).
            This line will be your command.
            The function <code>getline()</code> can be used to accomplish this easily.
            Beware that <code>getline()</code> may allocate memory that the user must free.
        	</p>
        	<h3 id = "pid">Task 3: Printing the PID of the Process Executing the Command</h3>
          Each time a new process is started with fork(), the PID of the new process must be printed like this:
        	<pre>
            <code>
          		Command executed by pid=x
          	</code>
          </pre>
        	You can use <code>printf("Command executed by pid=%d\n", pid)</code> to print out this process information.
          This should be printed in the child process to insure that this will be printed before any output of the child process.
        	<h3>Task 4: Decipher the Command</h3>
        	<p>
        		Shell supports two types of commands: built-in and non built-in.
        		While built-in commands are executed without creating a new process, a
        		non built-in command MUST create a new process to execute the program
        		for that particular command.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		A single space will separate words on the command line.
            For the purpose of simplicity, all commands we will test
        		will contain no extra whitespace anywhere in the command (or extra junk
        		that doesn&#39;t make sense like the <code>&quot; abc&quot;</code> in <code>&quot;!history abc&quot;</code>).
            This includes before the command, after the command,
        		or between different arguments.
            We also will not test a blank line (though your program should not crash on a blank line).
            We will also not test to see if you support the quoting semantics a regular Unix shell.
            In a full-featured shell, if you enter:
            <code>echo "hello there" 'hacker extraordinaire'</code>
            it will pass two arguments to the 'echo' command: "hello there" and "hacker extraordinaire".
        	</p>
        	<h4 id = "builtin">BUILT-IN COMMANDS</h4>
        	<p>
        		Your
        		Shell will support four built-in commands: cd, exit and three commands
        		(!history, !number, !query) based on a history feature.
            You should use the log from Part 1 to implement the history functionality.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        	</p>
        	<ul>
        		<li id = "cd">
        			<p><b>cd xxx</b></p>
        			<p>Changes the Shell&#39;s current working directory to &#39;xxx&#39;. [Hint: See function <code>chdir()</code>.]</p>
        			<p>
        				If for some reason (for example, xxx is not a valid directory) the command
        				&quot;cd&quot; does not end successfully, then Shell should retain its current working
        				directory and should print (without the quotes): <code>&quot;xxx: No such file or directory&quot;</code> to indicate the error.
        			</p>
              For example:
              <pre>
                <code>
                  (pid=1234)/home/user$ cd code<br/>
                  (pid=1234)/home/user/code$ cd imaginary_directory<br/>
                  imaginary_directory: No such file or directory<br/>
                  (pid=1234)/home/user/code$
          			</code>
              </pre>
        		</li>
        		<li id = "exit">
        			<p><b>exit</b></p>
        			<p>Terminates the Shell(frees all resources and has the log persist).</p>
        		</li>
        		<li id = "history">
        			<p><b>!history</b></p>
        			<p>
        				Prints for each command (in chronological order) its line number (0 indexed), a tab, the command itself, and a newline.
                Do not store !history in the history (this is the only command that will never store data in the history ... except for !# do to a technicality).
        				For example:
        			</p>
        			<pre>
                <code>
                  (pid=1234)/home/user$ !history<br/>
          				0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ls -l<br/>
          				1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pwd<br/>
          				2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ps<br/>
                  (pid=1234)/home/user$
          			</code>
              </pre>
        		</li>
            <li id = "index">

        			<p>
        				Re-executes the #th command in history (chronological order) and stores that in history as the command itself.
                Print the #th command before executing the command.
                If # is not a valid index then print "Invalid Index" (this should not be stored in the history).
                Note: that !# is not stored in history, because that is not the command being executed.

        	<h4 id = "nonbuiltin">NON BUILT-IN COMMANDS</h4>
        	<p>
        		If the command is not a Shell built-in (i.e., any command other than
        		cd, exit, !history, !#, !query), Shell should consider the command name to be
        		the name of a file that contains executable binary code. Such a code
        		must be executed in a process different from the one executing the
        		shell. You must use <code>fork(), exec(), wait()</code>.<br>
        	</p>
        	<p style = "color:red">If you use <code>system()</code> you will automatically fail this MP.</p>
          <p>Note: that you should store a "bad" commands (so your shell is not responsible for checking to see if the command exec()'ed  correctly before storing it in the log).</p>
        	<p>
        		The <code>fork(), exec(), wait()</code> paradigm is as follows: <code>fork()</code> a child process.
            The child process must execute the command with <code>exec()</code>, while the parent must <code>wait()</code> for the child to terminate before printing the next prompt.
            It is important to note that, upon a successful execution of the command, <code>exec()</code> never returns to the child process.
            <code>exec()</code> only returns to the child process when the command fails to execute successfully.
        		In that case, shell should print (without the quotes):  <code>&quot;xxx: not found&quot;</code>, where xxx is the executable name.<br/>
            For example:
            <pre>
              <code>
                (pid=1234)/home/user$ invalid_command --flag-that-is-ignored also_ignored also_ignored<br/>
                Command executed by pid=1235<br/>
                invalid_command: not found<br/>
                (pid=1234)/home/user$<br/>
              </code>
            </pre>
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		Failure to terminate the child process after an invalid command may
        		result in a fork bomb. You can find information about cleaning a system
        		after a fork bomb <a href="http://www.linuxhowtos.org/Tips%20and%20Tricks/ulimit.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p style="color:red;font-weight:bold">
      		  If your code fork bombs during grading you will automatically recieve a 0 for this MP.
          </p>
        	<p>
        		Some non built-in commands that you may try to see whether your Shell works as it should are:
            <pre>
              <code>ls</code>, <code>/bin/ls,pwd</code>, <code>ps</code>, <code>echo hello</code>
            </pre>
          </p>
        	<h4 id = "bg">CMD &</h4>
        	<p>A command suffixed with & should be run in the background. (i.e. The shell should be ready to take the next command before the given command has finished running)</p>
        	<h4 id = "ctrlc">Ignore Ctrl+C</h4>
        	<p>Usually when we do *Ctrl+C*, the current running program will exit. However, we want the shell to ignore the *Ctrl+C signal*. (i.e. shell will not exit when a *Ctrl+C* signal comes).</p>
        </ul>
      <h2>Grading</h2>
      <a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs241/#/overview#integrity">These are the Academic Integrity rules, shared between all MPs in CS 241. Please read them; they're for your own benefit.</a>
      <p>Here's the grading breakdown:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li><strong>25%</strong>: Part 1</li>
      	<li><strong>75%</strong>: Part 2</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        We want to keep an open feedback loop, and
