<article class="post-content">
  <p>This post is intended to be a continuation of the previous post discussing study
groups. You can probably find that post pretty easily on this site. If you
haven’t seen it, go back and read it!</p>

<p>I would also like to say that I am quite interested in criticism of this little
article. I don’t intend to go much farther with this project, but discussion
about it could be quite interesting. And of course if you find errors, let me
know!</p>

<h2 id="simulation">Simulation</h2>
<p>I’ve expanded the model a bit for this one. Here is what happens:</p>

<ol>
  <li>People enter a room one at a time</li>
  <li>People will chose the study group with best fitness and join it</li>
  <li>On occasion, an individual will decide to be selfless, meaning, the
  individual will not join a group if their joining will hurt the fitness of the
  group
    <ul>
      <li>if an individual attempts to be selfless, but there are no groups they can
join without hurting them, they will have to join normally</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After a member has joined, for every group, if the group’s size is greater
  than the optimal group size, there is some chance the group will split
    <ul>
      <li>if the group splits, half of the groups members stay in the group and the
other half all join groups one at a time (goto 1 essentially for every
member that has left the group)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Just to recap, fitness is determined based on group size, using this
differential equation:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{dF}{dn} = \alpha - \beta n</script>

<p>where $ \alpha $ is an individual member’s contribution (every member is
assumed to have the same contribution) and $ \beta $ is the amount the member
will detract from the group (also assumed the same for all members).</p>

<p>The chance an individual will be selfless is some percentage, also assumed
constant for all members.</p>

<p>And finally, the chance come group will split, given that it has exceeded the
optimal size, is another percentage.</p>

<p>One more detail, in the simulation, I have set a fixed number of available
groups. All groups start with 0 members. As long as the number of available
groups is substantially larger than the number of people to join the groups,
this fact doesn’t seem to have an effect on the results. However, if we do
something like try and cram 16 people into 10 groups, that can get kind of
interesting.</p>

<p>Because there is some element of randomness, I will run many trials of the
simulation to get results.</p>

<h2 id="criticism-of-the-model">Criticism of the model</h2>
<p>There are a couple obvious problems with this model.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Realistically, people do not all contribute equally to a group, this is a
pretty dramatic simplification. Same for member detriment and selflessness.
    <ul>
      <li>However, I did a small test to see how much of an impact this has and I
(weakly) concluded that for large $ n $ this effect goes away.
Unfortunatley, I’m not really testing with large $ n $, so we will have
to take this fact into consideration in our interpretation of the results.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The selflessness idea is fairly unrealistic. In reality an individual can’t
determine if their joining will damage the fitness of the group, because they
have no concrete way to compute the group’s fitness. However, because this is
done by chance, if we keep the chance low we can approximate the effect of
this optimal size uncertainty. To explain what I mean, consider this. Assume
an individual can only estimate whether or not they will hurt a group, and
lets say they are only right 50 percent of the time. Then, lets say that this
person has a 50 percent chance of being selfless. So essentially, given a
group above optimal size, there is a 25 percent chance the person won’t join
it. We can consider this when setting the selflessness parameter.</li>
  <li>The way groups split is fairly unrealistic. Groups, like individuals, can’t
say for sure if they are above optimal size. However, using the same argument
as the previous, I think we can get away with this.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, the biggest flaw we will have to overcome is (1), but, the specific kind of
experiment I plan to run lessens the impact of this problem.</p>

<h2 id="the-experiment">The Experiment</h2>
<p>I intend to try and figure out if group splitting or individual selflessness
will do a better job at keeping groups close to optimal size (or at least not
create tons of 1 person groups or tons of very large groups).</p>

<p>So, for some values of $ \alpha $, and $ \beta $, I varied both the
selflessness chance and the group split chance from 0.0 to 0.95, in 5 percent
increments. So every pair is tested.</p>

<p>I’ve created some plots to demonstrate my results. I’m also kind of lazy, so I
didn’t label them, but, I’ll give you a badly labeled example here just to be
nice.</p>

<p>This particular image is shows the percentage of groups at optimal size for
various values of selflessness and group split chance.</p>

<p><img src="/img/study_groups/2/5_optimal.png" alt="joiners=5, max=50, optimal" /></p>

<p>All of the images from here on out are essentially the same, although they
grayness may have a different meaning, I’ll be careful to explain what you are
looking at in the file names and in this document, but I’m not going to go back
all the images, sorry!</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>First test we are going to look at.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>member_contrib=1.000000
member_detriment=0.500000
num_joiners=5
max_groups=50
trials=1000
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Here are the images for all the results:</p>

<h4 id="percentage-of-groups-at-optimal-size">Percentage of groups at optimal size</h4>
<p><img src="/img/study_groups/2/5_optimal.png" alt="joiners=5, at optimal" /></p>

<h4 id="percentage-of-groups-above-optimal-size">Percentage of groups above optimal size</h4>
<p><img src="/img/study_groups/2/5_above_optimal.png" alt="joiners=5, above optimal" /></p>

<h4 id="percentage-of-groups-below-optimal-size">Percentage of groups below optimal size</h4>
<p><img src="/img/study_groups/2/5_below_optimal.png" alt="joiners=5, below optimal" /></p>

<h4 id="average-fitness-of-groups">Average fitness of groups</h4>
<p><img src="/img/study_groups/2/5_avg_fit.png" alt="joiners=5, average fitness" /></p>

<p>So, what did we learn here? Well, it looks like the best way to increase chances
of getting groups to their optimal size is having a moderate percentage of
groups splitting, with no selflessness. We can also see that we get the fewest
groups below optimal size at this point (not many really small groups), but we
still end up with a decent percentage above optimal size.</p>

<p>One possible explanation for this seemingly unintuitive result could lie in my
group splitting logic. When groups split, they split down to optimal size, then
the other members get a chance to go join other groups. These members are likely
to join small groups, close to their optimal size, bringing the number of small
groups down. We can end up with a decent number of groups above optimal size
because splitting doesn’t happen all that often (the split percent in the
region we are investigating is only 30%).</p>

<p>We can also kind of see the same thing happen with selflessness around 65-70
percent, but the effect is nowhere near as pronounced.</p>

<p>The other notable fact is that, although the greatest percentage of optimal
groups seems to happen with a small chance of groups splitting, this is not where
the average group fitness is highest. The greatest rate of chance in average
fitness still looks to be occurring as the chance a group splits increases,
meaning that the averages fitness of groups improves faster as we increase
the chance of a group splitting than it improves as we increase the chance of
selflessness.</p>

<p>Also, something strange seems to be happening with the average fitness graph.
I can’t really explain that or form much of a conclusion about it. Nothing else
grabbed my attention.</p>

<p>I ran only a few more tests, here are the parameters and links to my results.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>member_contrib=1.000000

<p><a href="/img/study_groups/2/15_optimal.png">at optimal</a>

<a href="/img/study_groups/2/15_below_optimal.png">below optimal</a>
<a href="/img/study_groups/2/15_avg_fit.png">average fitness</a></p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>member_contrib=1.000000
member_detriment=0.500000
num_joiners=20
max_groups=50
trials=1000
</code></pre>
</div>
<p><a href="/img/study_groups/2/20_optimal.png">at optimal</a>
<a href="/img/study_groups/2/20_above_optimal.png">above optimal</a>
<a href="/img/study_groups/2/20_below_optimal.png">below optimal</a>
<a href="/img/study_groups/2/20_avg_fit.png">average fitness</a></p>

<p>As you can see, if you looked at these images, the results are fairly consistent
across my tests.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It would seem that selflessness doesn’t much help, but group splitting does. If
you are shooting to find the optimal group size, have a moderate to low percent
chance of splitting, and if you want to maximize the average fitness of all the
study groups in you meta-study-group group, have a moderate to high chance of
splitting. Either way, splitting groups seems to improve the effectiveness of
study groups more so than people choosing not to join them when they think they
would hurt the group, which seems somewhat intuitive.</p>

<p>To briefly consider the real world, consider that some people damage the group
more than others, or help the group more. I think that this effect doesn’t
really damage the strength of my conclusion, because I am simply proposing that
splitting groups when they seem to be becoming unproductive may be an effective
way to increase study group effectiveness. When splitting the groups in real
life, it is probably a good idea to consider who’s who, and of course, if a
major productivity killer person decides to not join a group, that will help the
group out quite a bit more than choosing to split later.</p>

<p>Hopefully this was interesting to you! If you’ve seen anything I haven’t please
tell me!!</p>

<h2 id="a-bit-about-implementation">A bit about implementation</h2>
<p>I wrote this code a couple of different ways, but eventually settled on Haskell
as the language for the simulation. I also chose to leave randomness in the
simulation, instead of finding all possible outcomes for some given set of
parameters and computing percentages from that (the number of cases seems quite
large, although performance of what I came up with isn’t phenomenal). I also
wrote a python script to run multiple instances of the simulation (which is
single threaded), and collect the results. The, finally, I used R to spit out
the rather unpolished graphics I used.</p>

<p>The code is on github, here is a
