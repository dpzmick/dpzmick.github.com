  <h1>Decision Matrix</h1>
  <span class="post-meta">Jan 17, 2014</span><br>
  
</div>

<article class="post-content">
  <p>Decision matrix analysis is a simple way of selecting one of many options. This
post exists to allow me to dump thoughts somewhere (so I don’t forget them)
and share them with others easily. I will probably update this document as
I have new ideas.</p>

<h2 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h2>
<p>Simply put, a decision consists of objectives and alternatives. An objective is
something you want to fulfill by making the decision. For example, a career
decision objective may be “Decent Pay” or “Short Commute.” In deciding what
university to attend, objectives may be things such as “Academic Rating,”
“Class Size,” and “Cost.” These objectives all have an importance, or weight.
When selecting a car to purchase, the objective “Low Fuel Consumption” may be
extremely important to you, but “Heated Seats” might be less important. I would
say that fuel economy is weighted more heavily than heated seats, if this were
the case.</p>

<p>Alternatives, or options, are the different options you have to choose from, so,
in the car example, my options may be a Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, and a
Maserati. To evaluate these options, assign a rating for each of your chosen
objectives. So, say my objectives were Cost and Style. The Maserati
would get a “Very Displeased” for cost, but a “Very Pleased” for style, and the
Camry would get a “Very pleased” for cost, and a “Somewhat Pleased” for style.</p>

<p>So, this decision in table form would look something like this:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center">Objectives</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Cost: Important</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Style: Somewhat Important</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Maserati</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Very Displeased</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Very Pleased</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Camry</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Very Pleased</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Somewhat Pleased</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You can then define a scale for your ratings and weights and use the matrix to
determine which option best meets your needs. The score for each option is the
sum of each rating multiplied by the ratings weight.</p>

<p>This technique is extremely useful for increasing self awareness, as it forces
you to explain your thought process to yourself, place value on your objectives,
and collect fairly decent data about your options. The technique also allows you
to understand trade offs. In the example above, if we chose the Camry, we would
be sacrificing a bit on Style to save on Cost. Because a low cost is important
to us, we may be willing to make that trade. Using the technique also creates a
mechanism to experiment. You can ask question like, “How much cheaper would the
Maserati need to be for it to become ‘better’ than the Camry,” or, “How much of
a pay cut am I willing to take to continue living in Houston?”</p>

<h2 id="mathematical-definitions">Mathematical Definitions</h2>
<p>To model a decision with $n$ objectives and $m$ alternatives, define:</p>

<p>The objectives vector:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbf{o} =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        w_1 \\
        w_2 \\
        \vdots  \\
        w_n
    \end{pmatrix}</script>

<p>where:</p>

<p>$ w_i $ = the weight given to the ith objective.</p>

<p>The vector <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
\mathbf{a_i} = \begin{pmatrix} r_1 & r_2 & \cdots & r_m \end{pmatrix} %]]></script>
for the ith alternative, where $ r_k $ is the ith alternative’s rating for the
kth objective.</p>

<p>The alternative matrix</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A = \begin{pmatrix}
    \mathbf{a_1} \\
    \mathbf{a_2} \\
    \vdots \\
    \mathbf{a_m}
\end{pmatrix}</script>

<p>The relative strengths of each alternative are given by $ A\mathbf{o} $.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Let us revist the car example. Suppose my objectives are Cost, Style, and
Comfort. Using a 1-5 importance scale, Cost would have an importance of 5, Style
and importance of 2, and Comfort an importance of 4.</p>

<p>This means</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbf{o} = \begin{pmatrix}
    5 \\
    2 \\
    4
\end{pmatrix}</script>

<p>Now, let us consider 3 options and evaluate them on a using a negative 3 to 3
scale.</p>

<p>The Maserati would get a -3 for Cost, a 3 for Style, and a 3 for Comfort.</p>

<p>A Camry would get a 1 for Cost, a 1 for Style, and a 2 for comfort.</p>

<p>And, a Civic would get a 3 for Cost (I have no idea if this is true), a 1 for
style, and a 2 for comfort.</p>

<p>So, we build our alternatives matrix.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
    -3 & 3 & 3 \\
     1 & 1 & 2 \\
     3 & 1 & 2
\end{pmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>And get each alternative’s score:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
A\mathbf{o} =
\begin{pmatrix}
    -3 & 3 & 3 \\
     1 & 1 & 2 \\
     3 & 1 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
    5 \\
    2 \\
    4
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
    -3(5) + 3(2) + 3(4) \\
     1(5) + 1(2) + 2(4) \\
     3(5) + 1(2) + 2(4)
\end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
    3 \\
    15 \\
    25
\end{pmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>So, given our objectives, their importances, and our evaluation of our options
using those objectives, a Civic is probably the best option for us.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>Now that we have a model of a decision, it is interesting to ask a few questions
about the model, for example:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What are we trading for what? In the car example we traded our desire for
comfort and style for our desire to keep cost low.</li>
  <li>How much would we have to sacrifice on cost to make the Maserati the best
option?</li>
  <li>Which of our objectives have impact? If an objective gets the same, or close
to the same rating for each candidate, it doesn’t really impact the decision.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="trade-offs">Trade offs</h2>
<p>Referring back to our car example, how can we try and understand what we are
trading if we chose the Maserati over the Civic?</p>

<p>Let’s define $ \mathbf{t}(i,j) = \mathbf{a_i} - \mathbf{a_j} $ to be the trades made if
alternative $ i $ is selected over alternative $ j $. Any negative value in
$ \mathbf{t} $ represents a sacrificed objective in the trade, and any positive
value represents something gained. So, if the 1st element is negative and the
last two are positive, we’ve sacrificed on our first objective for gains on our
second and third.</p>

<p>Remember that $ \mathbf{a_1} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 &amp; 3 &amp; 3 \end{pmatrix} $ for the
Maserati and $ \mathbf{a_3} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix} $ for the Civic.</p>

<p>$ \mathbf{t}(1,3) =  \mathbf{a_1} - \mathbf{a_3} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \end{pmatrix} $
So, if we were to choose the Maserati over the Civic, we would be sacrificing
money (first objective) to gain comfort and style (second and third objectives).
But, we aren’t willing to make this trade; we’ve demonstrated that in the
previous example. Let us investigate the trade here again. A trade make sense
if the gains in the trade outweigh the loses ($gains - losses \gt 0 $). The
total gain is the sum of each positive number in $t$ multiplied by the weight
associated with it. Similarly, total loss is just the sum of each negative
number multiplied by the associated weight.</p>

<p>Remember</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbf{o} =
\begin{pmatrix}
    5 \\
    2 \\
    4
\end{pmatrix}</script>

<p>In this example, $ gains = 1(2) + 1(4) = 6 $ and $ losses = 6(5) = 30 $. We
can see this is not a valid trade because $ 6 - 30 = -24 $ is much less than
zero! If we were to go the other way (what do we trade if we chose the Civic
over the Maserati), all the signs would reverse, and the trade would be a good
trade.</p>

<p>Since gains are positive and losses are negative in the vector we get by
subtracting alternatives, we can express the validity of a choice of alternative
$i$ over alternative $j$ more simply with the statement:
$ \sum_{k=0}^{n} \mathbf{t}(i,j)_k w_k \gt 0 $</p>

<p>Check: $ \sum_{k=0}^{3} \mathbf{t}(1,3)_k w_k = -6(5) + 1(2) + 1(4) = -24 $</p>

<p>To understand what adjustments in objective importance might be needed to make
the Maserati a better choice, we can try adjusting weights and recalculating
Or, we can try using a bit of linear programming.</p>

<p>We are attempting to satisfy $ -6w_1 + 1w_2 + 1w_3 \gt 0 $ under the
constraint $ 0 \ge w_1, w_2, w_3 \ge 5 $ (from our rating scale). A good
solver can give you results in this region. To simplify the solution, lets say
we feel very strongly about the importance of cost, we don’t plan on assigning
any less importance to that, but a good salesman may be able to convince us that
our comfort or style is more important than we think at the moment.</p>

<p>This leaves us with $ -30 +1w_2 + 1w_3 \gt 0 $ bounded by $ 0 \ge w_2, w_3 \ge 5 $</p>

<p>Making a plot of this region, we can see that there exit no feasible solutions,
so, we can tell that it is not possible for us to choose to purchase the
Maserati over the Civic without compromising on cost.</p>

<p>The green region is the region given by our weighting system (1-5) and the orange
region is the region of weights for Comfort and Style that would make the
Maserati reasonable for us.</p>

<p><img src="/img/decision_matrix/not_feasible.png" alt="plot of feasible region" /></p>

<p>If we decided to become flexible on cost and make comfort extremely important
(weight of 5), then the region would look like this (where the red region is the
region in which we would the Maserati, the importance of cost is along the
y-axis and the importance of style is along the x-axis)</p>

<p><img src="/img/decision_matrix/feasible.png" alt="plot of feasible region" /></p>

<p>This analysis could continue and could be done in more dimensions analytically,
but I believe I have demonstrated the methodology I’ve found to be interesting
(maybe even useful?). I may explain in detail how I choose to use some of these
ideas in WhichOne in a future post.</p>

<h4 id="other-ideas">Other ideas:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Determine analytically what weights to assign so that an alternative beats
another (instead of just guessing).</li>
  <li>Find a way to represent all the trades that exist in a decision with a single
structure.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="objective-impact">Objective Impact</h2>
<p>Say I give you</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbf{o} = \begin{pmatrix}
    5 \\
    1 \\
    3
\end{pmatrix}</script>

<p>and</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
    3 & -1 & 3 \\
    3 & 3  & 1 \\
    3 & -1 & -3
\end{pmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>Notice that the rankings for the first objective are all
exactly the same! This means that the first objective has no impact on the
decision; it only inflates scores. This fact motivates a method of determining
objective impact.</p>

<p>My dad suggests using the variance of the weighted ratings to determine this
impact score. Before I discuss my thoughts about this method let me explain it.
First a bit more notation.</p>

<p>let</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbf{o_k} = \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\
    \vdots \\
    0 \\
    w_k \\
    0 \\
    \vdots \\
    0
\end{pmatrix}</script>

<p>be the vector containing the weight of the kth objective, in the
appropriate space, with all other weights set to zero.</p>

<p>I’ve decided to call $ A\mathbf{o}_k $ the impact vector for objective $k$
because the vector represents how the objective $k$ changes alternatives scores
in this decision.</p>

<p>Using the above defined objectives vector and alternatives matrix we get the
following impact vectors:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \begin{pmatrix}
    5 \\
    0 \\
    0
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
    15 \\\\
    15 \\\\
    15
\end{pmatrix}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\
    1 \\
    0
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
    -1 \\
    3 \\
    -1
\end{pmatrix}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\
    0 \\
    3
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
    9 \\
    1 \\
    -9
\end{pmatrix}</script>

<p>Now, let the impact of the kth objective
$ Impact(k) = PopulationVariance( A\mathbf{o_k} ) $, so in this example
$ Impact(1) = 0 $,
$ Impact(2) = \frac{32}{9} \approx 3.5556 $
$ Impact(3) = \frac{488}{9} \approx 54.222 $</p>

<p>These results seem to be a good indicator of how much impact each objective has
on the decision. However, it may be better to use the standard deviation instead
of variance to reduce the effect squaring. Variance/standard deviation of the
impact vectors is also a good measure of impact because it not only factors in
ratings for each objective and the score each objective was given. However, I’m
not entirely convinced that the variance or s.d. gives the best possible picture
of how an objectives “changes” a decision, because it only looks at impact
vectors, not at how these vectors pull your choices one way or another (doesn’t
factor in trade offs to determine influence). Again, this is more of a
theoretical question, practically variance/s.d. performs well.</p>

<h4 id="warning-what-follows-is-not-well-structured-or-explained">WARNING: What follows is not well structured or explained.</h4>

<p>Here is another idea for understanding trade offs and objective impact I’ve been
toying with.</p>

<p>Lets make the problem a 2D problem, for the sake of visualization, by dropping
the last alternative. This leaves us with</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbf{o} = \begin{pmatrix}
    5 \\
    1 \\
    3
\end{pmatrix}</script>

<p>and</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
    3 & -1 & 3 \\
    3 & 3  & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>And, our impact vectors are</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{pmatrix}
    15 \\
    15
\end{pmatrix}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{pmatrix}
    -1 \\
    3
\end{pmatrix}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{pmatrix}
    9 \\
    3
\end{pmatrix}</script>

<p>Let’s plot those along with the line $ y = x $</p>

<p><img src="/img/decision_matrix/impact.png" alt="plot of impact vectors" /></p>

<p>This plot may be a bit difficult to wrap your head around (it is for me), but
let’s walk through it. Our x and y axis represent alternative scores.</p>

<p>Think about what would happen if an objective resulted in an impact vector of</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\begin{pmatrix}
    15 \\\
    0
\end{pmatrix}</script>

<p>This objective clearly favors the first alternative (it adds 15
to $ a_1 $’s score, and 0 to $ a_2 $’s score. In this case that would be
something that very much favors the first alternative. Plotted, we would get this.</p>

<p><img src="/img/decision_matrix/wow.png" alt="wow plot" /></p>

<p>So, we can say, in the 2D case, that the closer to the positive x-axis a vector
is ($x \gt y$ ), the more it favors the first alternative.  The closer to the
positive y-axis the vector is ( $ x \lt y $ ), the more it favors the second
alternative. So, looking back at our example for this section, the big blue
vector has no impact.</p>

<p>It may be possible to define an importance function using these vectors and
their distance from the neutral line ( $ x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_n $ ) for n
alternatives, but I haven’t yet explored this entirely. If I do, I will post
again probably explaining the process. Practically, variance works well enough.
But, I think this is a really cool, fun way to think about objectives.</p>

<h4 id="maserati-and-camry-example">Maserati and Camry example</h4>
<p>Let’s do this with the Maserati and Camry again. Same objectives.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbf{o} = \begin{pmatrix}
    5 \\
    2 \\
    4
\end{pmatrix}</script>

<p>and only two alternatives (to avoid going into 3d space)</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
A = \begin{pmatrix}
    -3 & 3 & 3 \\
     3 & 1 & 2
\end{pmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>Impact Vectors:</p>

<p>For Cost (in blue):</p>

<p>$$ A \begin{pmatrix} 5 \ 0 \ 0 \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
    -15 <br />
    15
\end{pmatrix} $</p>

<p>For Comfort (in orange):</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
    6 \\
    2
\end{pmatrix}</script>

<p>For Style (in red):</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix}
    12 \\
    8
\end{pmatrix}</script>

<p>Here is a plot:</p>

<p><img src="/img/decision_matrix/maserati_camry.png" alt="maserati camry plot" /></p>

<p>In terms of impact, the cost vector is perpendicular to the neutral line. This
is as far from neutral as possible! Cost clearly has a large amount of impact.
Understanding the “which direction does this objective pull my decision” thing
is quite a bit harder here and I can only kind of see it. But, this train of
though may still hold some potential.</p>

<h4 id="other-ideas-1">Other ideas:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Finish determining impact using distance of impact vector to neutral line.</li>
  <li>Evaluate trade offs using the “pull” of an impact vector.</li>
</ol>
