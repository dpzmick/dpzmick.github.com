  <h1 id="work-in-progress">WORK IN PROGRESS</h1>

<p>For my CS242 final project, I simulated ants with Erlang.</p>

<p>In the following video we have an XXXXXX by YYYYY grid with AAAAAA ants running
around on it. There is food at (XXX,YYY).</p>

<h2 id="model">Model</h2>
<p>I’ve attempted to capture two behaviors of real ants with my simulation: ants
communicate using pheromones (scents), and they want to find food.</p>

<p>Pheromones are a way for an ant to communicate the location of food to other
ants. Each cell in the simulation has a pheromone strength associated with it.
When an ant moves, it uses the pheromone strength of the cells around it to
compute the probability that it will move in that direction.</p>

<p>Additionally, my ants have multiple movement modes.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> They can be in “away
from home” mode or “towards home” mode. When an ant starts moving, it favors
moving away from its starting cell. When it finds food, it switches modes and
favors moving towards its starting cell. If it ever reaches the starting cell,
it switches modes again and goes to find more food. I believe that real ants also
use pheromones to find their way back home (instead of magically remembering the
absolute coordinates of their homes), but I used this method to simplify the
model while still sort of capturing the return to home behavior.</p>

<p>Food can be placed on any cell in the simulation. Nothing actually tracks how
much food gets carried home, and the supply of food at a given cell does not
change when an ant discovers food. If I were to continue the project, it would
be really interesting to see how much food actually gets “home” and to include a
changing food supply in the model.</p>

<h2 id="pheromone-propagation">Pheromone Propagation</h2>
<p>When an ant is at a given cell, it gets the max pheromone strength of its
neighbors. It then checks if the strength of the its current cell is greater
than the max strength of its neighboring cells. If its current cell has a lower
pheromone value than the max of its neighbors, the ant updates the strength of
the current cell to half of the max strength of its neighbors.</p>

<p>When ants find food, they set the pheromone strength of the cell the food was on
to a high value, then they start moving back home. This should, in theory, cause
the pheromone trail to follow them. This doesn’t work as well as I had hoped
because the pheromone trail drops off too quickly, but, it is easy to implement,
so I stuck with it.</p>

<p>Here is a zoomed in view of the pheromone values near the food at the end of
simulation I showed a video of earlier:</p>

<p>SCENT VIS GOES HERE</p>

<h2 id="the-erlang-stuff">The Erlang Stuff</h2>
<p>If you aren’t familiar with Erlang, here is a super quick overview of the
concurrency construct in the language.</p>

<p>Actors (processes in Erlang terminology) run concurrently and send messages to
each other. These messages are asynchronous, so if actor A sends a message to
actor B, it doesn’t wait for B to respond to proceed with it’s next instruction.
A message can also contain any sort of data you care to send.</p>

<p>An ant actor and a grid cell actor form the core of my simulation.</p>

<p>Cells know who their neighbors are, their pheromone strength, if they have food
on them, and which ant occupies the cell (can be undefined). Only one ant
can occupy a given cell at any moment in time.</p>

<p>A cell knows how to handle the following messages (and a few others):</p>

<ul>
  <li>who_are_your_neighbors - asks the cell to send a message to someone with its
neighbors</li>
  <li>move_me_to_you - tells the cell to set its current occupant to the ant sending
the message</li>
  <li>ive_left - tells the cell that the ant sending the message has left the cell</li>
</ul>

<p>Ants know what cell they are on, what direction they are going, where they
started, and a few other less important things.</p>

<p>Ants know how to handle these messages (and a few others):</p>

<ul>
  <li>wakeup_and_move - tells the ant to try to move somewhere</li>
  <li>neighbors - a message sent to an ant by a cell when the cell reports who its
neighbors are</li>
  <li>move_to - tells an ant to change its current cell to some other cell</li>
  <li>move_failed - tells an ant that its move failed</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="simulation">Simulation</h3>
<p>When the simulator starts, it loads a config file specifying things like the
size of the grid and the location of food, builds the grid of cells, puts ants
on the upper edge of the board, then starts a wakeup_and_move_loop for each ant.</p>

<p>These loops tell their respective ants to wake up and perform their move over
and over again until the simulation is shut down.</p>

<h3 id="wakeupandmove">Wakeup_and_move</h3>
<p>When an ant receives a wakeup_and_move message, it has to figure where it wants
to move, if it can move there, and it needs to perform the pheromone propagation
step. I don’t want to let two ants occupy the same cell at once, but it isn’t so
bad if one ant is sort of in two places at once (I think). Those rules motivate
the following sequence of messages for an ant move:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The ant receives a wakeup_and_move message</li>
  <li>The ant sends a who_are_your_neighbors message to its current cell</li>
  <li>The current cell receives the who_are_your_neighbors message and sends the
ant a “neighbors” message with the list of its neighboring cells</li>
  <li>The ant decides which of these neighbors to move to using probabilities
explained earlier</li>
  <li>The ant performs the pheromone propagation step</li>
  <li>The ant sends a move_me_to_you message to its selected cell</li>
  <li>The selected cell checks if it is currently occupied
    <ul>
      <li>If it isn’t occupied, it sets its current occupant to the ant trying to
move and sends a you_moved message back to the ant</li>
      <li>If it is occupied, it sends a move_failed message back to the ant</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The ant receives either a move_failed or a you_moved message
    <ul>
      <li>If the ant received a you_moved message, it sends an ive_left message to
its current cell, updates its current cell to the selected cell, then goes
back to sleep</li>
      <li>If the ant receives a move_failed message, it does nothing and goes back
to sleep</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h5 id="sequence-diagram">Sequence Diagram:</h5>

<p><a href="/img/ants/sequence.png"><img src="/img/ants/sequence.png" alt="sequence diagram" /></a></p>

<p>If you look carefully, you might notice that, between steps 7 and 8, two cells
think they are occupied by the same ant. This prevents collisions but introduces
this strange “ant in flux” state. I would rather accept the double occupancy
issue than the collision issue.</p>

<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<p>As the simulation runs, the ants are generating all sorts of data that should
probably be recorded somewhere. This is a bit of a challenge because there is no
single entity that knows the state of the entire system at any given time, so
you can’t just ask it to record a sample of the state of the simulation
somewhere every once and a while.</p>

<p>I decided that ants should be responsible for reporting their own movements and
should report the pheromone strength changes they make. For a couple of reasons
that don’t totally make sense, I decided to create one file per ant, and have
the ants log timestamped (wall clock time) events to those files. So, for a 2000
ant simulation, I end up with 2000 ant-event files on disk somewhere.</p>

<p>There are all sorts of things wrong with the one file per ant approach.</p>

<p>The biggest is speed. Having one file per ant means I have to merge all of these
ant-event files before making a visualization. These files can get large so this
is a slow process (and memory intensive if you write your script poorly (oops)).</p>

<p>Other than speed, one file per ant puts an upper limit on the number of ants I
can simulate at a time, because I can’t open an unlimited number of files on any
operating system. I won’t even mention the strange I/O behavior.</p>

<p>Fortunately, computers are fast, events are small, and I have a decent amount of
memory in my laptop, so this technique was “fast enough” given the scope of the
project.</p>

<h2 id="making-the-video">Making the Video</h2>
<p>Ants are moving all the time in an uncoordinated manner, moving a lot, and
sometimes moving at exactly the same time, so there isn’t a totally obvious way
to decide when to draw a video frame. I ended up taking 100 miliseconds worth of
move actions (timestamps are in real earth time) and use the last position of
every ant in that time slice to make a frame. Making frames was easy. I used a
big numpy array of pixels, threw that array at MoviePy, and MoviePy spit
out a video.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Better ways to simulate ants but Erlang is cool and this was fun thanks for
reading.</p>
