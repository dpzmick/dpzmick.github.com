</header><p>
This post is intended to be a continuation of the previous post
discussing study groups. You can probably find that post pretty easily
on this site. If you haven't seen it, go back and read it!
</p>

<p>
I would also like to say that I am quite interested in criticism of this
little article. I don't intend to go much farther with this project, but
discussion about it could be quite interesting. And of course if you
find errors, let me know!
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org406c999" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org406c999">Simulation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org406c999">
<p>
I've expanded the model a bit for this one. Here is what happens:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>People enter a room one at a time</li>
<li>People will chose the study group with best fitness and join it</li>
<li>On occasion, an individual will decide to be selfless, meaning, the
individual will not join a group if their joining will hurt the
fitness of the group

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if an individual attempts to be selfless, but there are no groups
they can join without hurting them, they will have to join normally</li>
</ul></li>

<li>After a member has joined, for every group, if the group's size is
greater than the optimal group size, there is some chance the group
will split

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>if the group splits, half of the groups members stay in the group
and the other half all join groups one at a time (goto 1
essentially for every member that has left the group)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>
Just to recap, fitness is determined based on group size, using this
differential equation:
</p>

<p>
\[ \frac{dF}{dn} = \alpha - \beta n \]
</p>

<p>
where $ &alpha; $ is an individual member's contribution (every member is
assumed to have the same contribution) and $ &beta; $ is the amount the
member will detract from the group (also assumed the same for all
members).
</p>

<p>
The chance an individual will be selfless is some percentage, also
assumed constant for all members.
</p>

<p>
And finally, the chance come group will split, given that it has
exceeded the optimal size, is another percentage.
</p>

<p>
One more detail, in the simulation, I have set a fixed number of
available groups. All groups start with 0 members. As long as the number
of available groups is substantially larger than the number of people to
join the groups, this fact doesn't seem to have an effect on the
results. However, if we do something like try and cram 16 people into 10
groups, that can get kind of interesting.
</p>

<p>
Because there is some element of randomness, I will run many trials of
the simulation to get results.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb20ab2e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgb20ab2e">Criticism of the model</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb20ab2e">
<p>
There are a couple obvious problems with this model.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Realistically, people do not all contribute equally to a group, this
is a pretty dramatic simplification. Same for member detriment and
selflessness.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>However, I did a small test to see how much of an impact this has
and I (weakly) concluded that for large $ n $ this effect goes
away. Unfortunatley, I'm not really testing with large $ n $, so we
will have to take this fact into consideration in our
interpretation of the results.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The selflessness idea is fairly unrealistic. In reality an individual
can't determine if their joining will damage the fitness of the
group, because they have no concrete way to compute the group's
fitness. However, because this is done by chance, if we keep the
chance low we can approximate the effect of this optimal size
uncertainty. To explain what I mean, consider this. Assume an
individual can only estimate whether or not they will hurt a group,
and lets say they are only right 50 percent of the time. Then, lets
say that this person has a 50 percent chance of being selfless. So
essentially, given a group above optimal size, there is a 25 percent
chance the person won't join it. We can consider this when setting
the selflessness parameter.</li>
<li>The way groups split is fairly unrealistic. Groups, like individuals,
can't say for sure if they are above optimal size. However, using the
same argument as the previous, I think we can get away with this.</li>
</ol>

<p>
So, the biggest flaw we will have to overcome is (1), but, the specific
kind of experiment I plan to run lessens the impact of this problem.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org7837fa8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org7837fa8">The Experiment</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org7837fa8">
<p>
I intend to try and figure out if group splitting or individual
selflessness will do a better job at keeping groups close to optimal
size (or at least not create tons of 1 person groups or tons of very
large groups).
</p>

<p>
So, for some values of $ &alpha; $, and $ &beta; $, I varied both the
selflessness chance and the group split chance from 0.0 to 0.95, in 5
percent increments. So every pair is tested.
</p>

<p>
I've created some plots to demonstrate my results. I'm also kind of
lazy, so I didn't label them, but, I'll give you a badly labeled example
here just to be nice.
</p>

<p>
This particular image is shows the percentage of groups at optimal size
for various values of selflessness and group split chance.

<p>
So, what did we learn here? Well, it looks like the best way to increase
chances of getting groups to their optimal size is having a moderate
percentage of groups splitting, with no selflessness. We can also see
that we get the fewest groups below optimal size at this point (not many
really small groups), but we still end up with a decent percentage above
optimal size.
</p>

<p>
One possible explanation for this seemingly unintuitive result could lie
in my group splitting logic. When groups split, they split down to
optimal size, then the other members get a chance to go join other
groups. These members are likely to join small groups, close to their
optimal size, bringing the number of small groups down. We can end up
with a decent number of groups above optimal size because splitting
doesn't happen all that often (the split percent in the region we are
investigating is only 30%).
</p>

<p>
We can also kind of see the same thing happen with selflessness around
65-70 percent, but the effect is nowhere near as pronounced.
</p>

<p>
The other notable fact is that, although the greatest percentage of
optimal groups seems to happen with a small chance of groups splitting,
this is not where the average group fitness is highest. The greatest
rate of chance in average fitness still looks to be occurring as the
chance a group splits increases, meaning that the averages fitness of
groups improves faster as we increase the chance of a group splitting
than it improves as we increase the chance of selflessness.
</p>

<p>
Also, something strange seems to be happening with the average fitness
graph. I can't really explain that or form much of a conclusion about
it. Nothing else grabbed my attention.

<p>
I ran only a few more tests, here are the parameters and links to my
results.

<div id="outline-container-orgd8cc618" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd8cc618">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd8cc618">
<p>
It would seem that selflessness doesn't much help, but group splitting
does. If you are shooting to find the optimal group size, have a
moderate to low percent chance of splitting, and if you want to maximize
the average fitness of all the study groups in you meta-study-group
group, have a moderate to high chance of splitting. Either way,
splitting groups seems to improve the effectiveness of study groups more
so than people choosing not to join them when they think they would hurt
the group, which seems somewhat intuitive.
</p>

<p>
To briefly consider the real world, consider that some people damage the
group more than others, or help the group more. I think that this effect
doesn't really damage the strength of my conclusion, because I am simply
proposing that splitting groups when they seem to be becoming
unproductive may be an effective way to increase study group
effectiveness. When splitting the groups in real life, it is probably a
good idea to consider who's who, and of course, if a major productivity
killer person decides to not join a group, that will help the group out
quite a bit more than choosing to split later.

Hopefully this was interesting to you! If you've seen anything I haven't
please tell me!!

<h2 id="orge3e0e9d">A bit about implementation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge3e0e9d">
<p>
I wrote this code a couple of different ways, but eventually settled on
Haskell as the language for the simulation. I also chose to leave
randomness in the simulation, instead of finding all possible outcomes
for some given set of parameters and computing percentages from that
(the number of cases seems quite large, although performance of what I
came up with isn't phenomenal). I also wrote a python script to run
multiple instances of the simulation (which is single threaded), and
collect the results. The, finally, I used R to spit out the rather
unpolished graphics I used.
