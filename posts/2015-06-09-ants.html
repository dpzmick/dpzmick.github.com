For my CS242 final project, I simulated ants with Erlang.
</p>

<p>
In the following video we have a 1000 by 1000 grid with 2000 ants
running around on it. There is food in a small square on the upper left.
The simulation ran for 1 hour (53,840,103 events were recorded).

<h2 id="orgf6865b0">Model</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf6865b0">
<p>
I&rsquo;ve attempted to capture two behaviors of real ants with my simulation:
ants communicate using pheromones (scents), and they want to find food.
</p>

<p>
Pheromones are a way for an ant to communicate the location of food to
other ants. Each cell in the simulation has a pheromone strength
associated with it. When an ant moves, it uses the pheromone strength of
the cells around it to compute the probability that it will move in that
direction.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, my ants have multiple movement modes.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> They can be in
&ldquo;away from home&rdquo; mode or &ldquo;towards home&rdquo; mode. When an ant starts moving,
it favors moving away from its starting cell. When it finds food, it
switches modes and favors moving towards its starting cell. If it ever
reaches the starting cell, it switches modes again and goes to find more
food. I believe that real ants also use pheromones to find their way
back home (instead of magically remembering the absolute coordinates of
their homes), but I used this method to simplify the model while still
sort of capturing the return to home behavior.
</p>

<p>
There is a mechanism to change the relative importance of distance and
pheromone strength. When an ant finds food, it ignores pheromones until
it gets back home.
</p>

<p>
Food can be placed on any cell in the simulation. Nothing actually
tracks how much food gets carried home, and the supply of food at a
given cell does not change when an ant discovers food. If I were to
continue the project, it would be really interesting to see how much
food actually gets &ldquo;home&rdquo; and to include a changing food supply in the
model.

<h2 id="org0ed11a3">Pheromone Propagation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org0ed11a3">
<p>
When an ant is at a given cell, it gets the max pheromone strength of
its neighbors. It then checks if the strength of the its current cell is
greater than the max strength of its neighboring cells. If its current
cell has a lower pheromone value than the max of its neighbors, the ant
updates the strength of the current cell to half of the max strength of
its neighbors.
</p>

<p>
When ants find food, they set the pheromone strength of the cell the
food was on to a high value, then they start moving back home. This
should, in theory, cause the pheromone trail to follow them. This
doesn&rsquo;t work as well as I had hoped because the pheromone trail drops
off too quickly, but, it is easy to implement, so I stuck with it.

<h2 id="org320daf7">The Erlang Stuff</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org320daf7">
<p>
If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with Erlang, here is a super quick overview of
the concurrency construct in the language.
</p>

<p>
Actors (processes in Erlang terminology) run concurrently and send
messages to each other. These messages are asynchronous, so if actor A
sends a message to actor B, it doesn&rsquo;t wait for B to respond to proceed
with it&rsquo;s next instruction. A message can also contain any sort of data
you care to send.
</p>

<p>
An ant actor and a grid cell actor form the core of my simulation.
</p>

<p>
Cells know who their neighbors are, their pheromone strength, if they
have food on them, and which ant occupies the cell (can be undefined).
Only one ant can occupy a given cell at any moment in time.
</p>

<p>
A cell knows how to handle the following messages (and a few others):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>who_are_your_neighbors</code> - asks the cell to send a message to someone
with its neighbors</li>
<li><code>move_me_to_you</code> - tells the cell to set its current occupant to the ant
sending the message</li>
<li><code>ive_left</code> - tells the cell that the ant sending the message has left
the cell</li>
</ul>

<p>
Ants know what cell they are on, what direction they are going, where
they started, and a few other less important things.
</p>

<p>
Ants know how to handle these messages (and a few others):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>wakeup_and_move</code> - tells the ant to try to move somewhere</li>
<li><code>neighbors</code> - a message sent to an ant by a cell when the cell reports
who its neighbors are</li>
<li><code>move_to</code> - tells an ant to change its current cell to some other cell</li>
<li><code>move_failed</code> - tells an ant that its move failed</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf30774e" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf30774e">Simulation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf30774e">
<p>
When the simulator starts, it loads a config file
specifying things like the size of the grid and the location of food,
builds the grid of cells, puts ants on the upper edge of the board, then
starts a wakeup_and_move_loop for each ant.
</p>

<p>
These loops tell their respective ants to wake up and perform their move
over and over again until the simulation is shut down.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5018813" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5018813">Wakeup_and_move</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5018813">
<p>
When an ant receives a wakeup_and_move message, it has to figure where
it wants to move, if it can move there, and it needs to perform the
pheromone propagation step. I don&rsquo;t want to let two ants occupy the
same cell at once, but it isn&rsquo;t so bad if one ant is sort of in two
places at once (I think). Those rules motivate the following sequence
of messages for an ant move:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The ant receives a <code>wakeup_and_move</code> message</li>
<li>The ant sends a <code>who_are_your_neighbors</code> message to its current cell</li>
<li>The current cell receives the <code>who_are_your_neighbors</code> message and
sends the ant a <code>neighbors</code> message with the list of its neighboring
cells</li>
<li>The ant decides which of these neighbors to move to using
probabilities explained earlier</li>
<li>The ant performs the pheromone propagation step</li>
<li>The ant sends a <code>move_me_to_you</code> message to its selected cell</li>
<li>The selected cell checks if it is currently occupied

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If it isn&rsquo;t occupied, it sets its current occupant to the ant
trying to move and sends a you_moved message back to the ant</li>
<li>If it is occupied, it sends a move_failed message back to the ant</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The ant receives either a <code>move_failed</code> or a <code>you_moved</code> message

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If the ant received a <code>you_moved</code> message, it sends an <code>ive_left</code>
message to its current cell, updates its current cell to the
selected cell, then goes back to sleep</li>
<li>If the ant receives a move_failed message, it does nothing and goes
back to sleep</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>
If you look carefully, you might notice that, between steps 7 and 8, two
cells think they are occupied by the same ant. This prevents collisions
but introduces this strange &ldquo;ant in flux&rdquo; state. I would rather accept
the double occupancy issue than the collision issue.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgf2e7989" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf2e7989">Data</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf2e7989">
<p>
As the simulation runs, the ants are generating all sorts of data that
should probably be recorded somewhere. This is a bit of a challenge
because there is no single entity that knows the state of the entire
system at any given time, so you can&rsquo;t just record a sample of the state
of the simulation somewhere every once in a while.
</p>

<p>
So, I decided that ants should be responsible for reporting their own
movements and should report the pheromone strength changes they make.
For a couple of reasons that don&rsquo;t totally make sense, I decided to
create one file per ant, and have the ants log timestamped (wall clock
time) events to those files. So, for a 2000 ant simulation, I end up
with 2000 ant-event files on disk somewhere.
</p>

<p>
There are all sorts of things wrong with the one file per ant approach.
</p>

<p>
The biggest is speed. Having one file per ant means I have to merge all
of these ant-event files before making a visualization. These files can
get large so this is a slow process (and memory intensive if you write
your script poorly (oops)).
</p>

<p>
Other than speed, one file per ant puts an upper limit on the number of
ants I can simulate at a time because I can&rsquo;t open an unlimited number
of files on any sort of machine. I won&rsquo;t even mention the strange I/O
behavior.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, computers are fast, events are small, and I have a decent
amount of memory in my laptop, so this technique was &ldquo;fast enough&rdquo; given
the scope of the project.

<h2 id="orgb089c4b">Making the Video</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgb089c4b">
<p>
Ants are moving all the time in an uncoordinated manner, moving a lot,
and sometimes moving at exactly the same time so there isn&rsquo;t a totally
obvious way to decide when to draw a video frame. I took 100 miliseconds
worth of simulation data (timestamps are in real earth time) and used
the last position of every ant in that time slice to make a frame.
</p>

<p>
MoviePy makes the rest really easy. All I have to do is build a frame by
populating a numpy array, and throw that array at MoviePy. MoviePy
treats that like an array of pixels and spits out a video that plays
some number of frames per second.

<h2 id="orge0b0695">Conclusions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge0b0695">
<p>
The naive model of any movement I used almost works. If I were to
improve the pheromone propagation mechanism and add changing food
supplies, I suspect the behavior would become a bit more interesting.
Another next step would be the addition of some obstacles on the grid so
that the &ldquo;always favor moving away&rdquo; approach would fail, necessitating a
more intricate &ldquo;looking for food&rdquo; mechanism.
</p>

<p>
Erlang is an interesting language and I&rsquo;m glad I had an opportunity to
fiddle with it, but some of its peculiarities can be annoying. First of
all, the lack of static typing is a pain (I know about dialyzer). It is
also difficult to do things like prioritize certain messages over others
(if I want to shut down the simulation, I want my stop message to take
precedence over anything else), and badly behaving actors can create
strange situations. For example, it is possible that some misbehaving
actor can fly in and start sending wakeup_and_move messages to ants
while they are executing the 8 step move and confuse the ant, the cell
the ant is trying to move to, and the cell the ant is currently on.
Despite its oddities, the language and the VM are super cool and I would
use them again when appropriate.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, I would not say that this project was particularly
appropriate for Erlang. The actor model was an interesting way to think
about ants and cells, but the problem doesn&rsquo;t quite fit Erlang&rsquo;s
strengths as a fault-tolerant language for distributed systems. There is
a possibility that the distributed nature of Erlang might enable some
interesting simulation sort of things, but there is little reason to
take advantage of the fault tolerance in a project like this.
Additionally, there are others ways to implement a simulation like this
which mitigate many of the issues I encountered along the way (but might
introduce other ones).
</p>

<p>
Overall, this was a fun project and I&rsquo;m glad to have gotten to work on
it.
