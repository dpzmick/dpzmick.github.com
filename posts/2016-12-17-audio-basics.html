</header><p>
Recently, I've been working on a synthesizer (the kind that makes
sounds) in Rust. I am hoping to write a large number of little articles
about the things I learn as I work on this project.
</p>

<p>
To start off this series, here's a short article about audio
programming.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgdd4ab93" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdd4ab93">Digital audio</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdd4ab93">
<p>
To generate audio, audio software sends some digital audio signals to
the audio card. Digital audio signals are just lists of floating point
(decimal) numbers. Think of these numbers as "sound pressure" over time
(see <a href="https://docs.cycling74.com/max5/tutorials/msp-tut/mspdigitalaudio.html">this page</a> for more)
</p>

<p>
Because sound is continuous, we can't record every possible value.
Instead, we take measurements of the sound pressure values at some
evenly spaced interval. For CD quality audio, we take 44100 samples per
second, or, one sample every 23ish microseconds. We might sample a sine
wave like this (from Wikipedia):
</p>

</figure>

<p>
The audio card turns these lists of samples into some "real-world"
audio, which is then played through the speakers.
</p>
</div>

<h3 id="org2665ae7">Types of audio software</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2665ae7">
<p>
Next let's think about a few different kinds of audio software (this
list is by no means complete):
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Media players (your browser, whatever you listen to music with, a
game, etc)</li>
<li>Software instruments (think of a virtual piano)</li>
<li>Audio plugins (an equalizer in a music player, effects like
distortion and compression)</li>
<li>Software audio systems</li>
</ol>

<p>
Media players are pretty self explanatory, but the others might need
some explanation. Next on the list is "Software instruments." These are
just pieces of software that can be used to generate sounds. They are
played with external keyboards, or "programmed" with cool user
interfaces.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
Next up are audio plugins. These are pieces of software which take audio
as input, transform it in some way, then output the transformed audio.
For example, a graphical equalizer can adjust the volume of different
frequency ranges (make the bass louder, make the treble quieter):
</p>

</figure>

<p>
Finally, we come to what I'm calling a software audio system. Because
there is only one sound card on your system, any audio you are playing
on your computer must be mixed together, then sent to the audio card. On
windows, using the default audio system, I can mix audio with this
little mixer thing:
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.jackaudio.org/">Some audio systems</a> may also be able to send audio between
applications, send <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a> signals, keep audio applications in sync, and
perform many other tasks.
</p>

<p>
The software audio system provides a library which application
developers use to develop audio applications.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgdc63897" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgdc63897">Software audio systems</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdc63897">
<p>
Most software audio systems (as far as I know) tend to work the same
way. There is a realtime thread that generates samples and a bunch of
other threads that deal with everything else. The audio thread is
usually set up by the audio system's library. The library calls a user
provided callback function to get the samples it needs to deliver to the
audio card.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3324f22" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3324f22">How fast is realtime?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3324f22">
<p>
In the previous section, I claimed that, at 44.1 kHz (the standard CD
sample rate), we need to take one audio sample approximately every 23
microseconds. 23 microseconds seems pretty quick, but 192 kHz, a sample
must be taken about every 5 microseconds (192 kHz is becoming a bit of
an industry standard)!
</p>

<p>
At these speeds, it would not be possible for the audio system to call
our callback function to get every individual sample. Instead, the audio
library system ask us for larger batches of samples. If we simplify the
real world a bit, we can approximate how often our callback function
will be called. Here's a table comparing batch size to the time between
callback function calls (all times in milliseconds):

<p>
There are many complicated trade offs between sample rate/and batch
size, so I don't want to get into them now. You can read <a href="http://www.penguinproducer.com/Blog/2011/10/balancing-performance-and-reliability-in-jack/">this</a> for a
bit more information. Long story short, use the smallest batch size
your computer can handle.
</p>

<p>
As audio application developers, we should make sure that our code runs
as quickly as possible no matter what the batch size is. The time we
spend is time other audio applications cannot use. Even if we
theoretically have 5 milliseconds to run, using the entire 5
milliseconds can slow everyone else down.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbc31681" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbc31681">Time keeps on ticking</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbc31681">
<p>
If our callback function fails to generate samples quickly enough (or
uses up all of the CPU time), the audio system will produce crackles,
pops, and bad sounds. We call these buffer underruns (or xruns).
<b>Avoiding buffer underruns must be our top priority!</b>
</p>

<p>
Everything we do in our callback function must <i>always</i> complete quickly
and in a very predictable amount of time. Unfortunately, this constraint
eliminates many things we often take for granted, including:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Synchronization with locks</li>
<li>Blocking operations</li>
<li>Operations with high worst case runtime</li>
<li>Memory allocation with standard allocators</li>
</ul>

<p>
First, we can't use locks or semaphores or conditional variables or any
of those kinds of things inside of our realtime callback function. If
one of our other threads is holding the lock, it might not let go soon
enough for us to generate our samples on time! If you try to make sure
you locks will always be released quickly, the scheduler might step in
and ruin your plans (this is called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_inversion">Priority
Inversion</a>). There are some cases in which it <i>might</i> be okay to use
locks, but, in general, it is a good idea to avoid them.
</p>

<p>
Second, we cannot perform blocking operations in the realtime callback
function. Things that might block include access to the network, access
to a disk, and other system calls which might block while performing a
task. In general, if I/O needs to be performed, it is best to perform
the I/O on another thread and communicate the results to the realtime
thread. There are some interesting subtleties to this, for example, can
the following code perform I/O?
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-C++"><span class="org-type">int</span> <span class="org-function-name">callback</span>(<span class="org-comment-delimiter">/* </span><span class="org-comment">args */</span>) {
  <span class="org-type">float</span>* <span class="org-variable-name">samples</span> = <span class="org-comment-delimiter">// </span><span class="org-comment">get a contiguous array of samples in a nonblocking way</span>
  <span class="org-keyword">for</span> (<span class="org-type">size_t</span> <span class="org-variable-name">i</span> = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {
    output_sample( samples[i] );
  }
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Unfortunately, it can. If the array of samples is <i>extremely</i> large,
the samples might not all actually be in physical memory. When the
operating system must contend with increasing memory pressure, it may
move some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_(computer_memory)">virtual memory pages</a> it manages out of physical
memory. If the page isn't in main memory, the operating system has to
go get it from somewhere. These pages are often moved to a hard disk,
so getting them will require blocking I/O.
</p>

<p>
Luckily, this sort of thing is only an issue if your program uses
extremely large amounts of memory. Audio applications usually do not
have high memory requirements, but, if yours does, you operating system
may provide you with a workaround. On linux, we can use the system call
<code>mlockall</code> to make sure certain pages never leave physical memory:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
mlock(), mlock2(), and mlockall() lock part or all of the calling
process's virtual address space into RAM, preventing that memory from
being paged to the swap area.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Next, we want to avoid operations which have a high worst case
runtime.  This can be tricky because some things with bad worst case
runtime things have a reasonable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis">amortized</a> runtime.  The canonical
example of this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array">dynamic array</a>. A dynamic array can be inserted
into very quickly most of the time, but every so often it must
reallocate itself and copy all of its data somewhere else. For a large
array, this expensive copy might cause us to miss our deadline every
once and a while. Fortunately, for some data structures, we can push
these worst case costs around and make the operations realtime safe
(see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Dynamic_resizing">Incremental resizing</a>).
</p>

<p>
Finally, memory allocation with standard library allocators can cause
problems. Memory allocators are usually thread safe, which usually
means that the are locking something. Additionally, allocation
algorithms rarely make any time guarantees; the algorithms they use
can have very poor worst case runtimes. Standard library allocators
break both of our other rules! Luckily, we can still perform dynamic
memory allocation if we use <a href="http://www.gii.upv.es/tlsf/">specially designed allocators</a> or <a href="https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/blob/master/common/SC_AllocPool.h">pool
allocators</a> which do not violate our realtime constraints.

In general, there are a few cool tricks we can use to design around
these problems, but I'm not going to discuss any of them in this post.
Future posts will discuss possible solutions and many of their
tradeoffs, eventually.
